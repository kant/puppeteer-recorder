# Puppeteer Recorder

There is supposedly a Chrome DevTools feature called Recorder, which was spiked
in https://github.com/puppeteer/recorder.

It is an experimental feature hidden behind `enable-devtools-experiments` flag:
`chrome://flags/#enable-devtools-experiments`.

A good article on the topic seems to be this:

Playwright supposedly also has a recording option, available through its CLI:

I have not found good authoritative documentation for these features in either
of the two tools documentation pages.

## To-Do

### Demonstrate usage of both Puppeteer and Playwright recorders

### Verify whether Experiments are not behind a flag anymore
